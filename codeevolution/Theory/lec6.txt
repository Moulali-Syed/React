Class Components:

Class Components can also optionally receive props and return HTML

  Properties  ------>   ES6 Class  ------>  HTML(JSX)
    (props)


Class - can maintain a private state variable , that can helps it display something that is
private to that class Component


import React from 'react';

class GreetClass extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello Good Morning From Class Component </h1>
    }
}

export default GreetClass;

-----

import GreetClass from './Components/GreetClass';

function App(){
    return (<>
                <GreetClass/>
            </>
            )
}

Functional vs Class Components:

Functional:

Simple Functions
Use Func components as much as possible
Absence of this keyword
Solution without using state 
Mainly responsible for UI 

Class Components:
Maintain private data - state 
Complex UI logic
Life cycle hooks
